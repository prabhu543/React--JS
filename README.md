# React Projects 🚀

This repository contains multiple **React-based projects** that I have built while learning React.js. Each project focuses on different fundamental concepts of React, such as **state management, props, hooks, and component-based architecture**.

## 📌 Projects Included

1. **Counter App** – A simple counter application demonstrating **useState** for state management.
2. **To-Do App** – A to-do list application with the ability to **add** and **remove** tasks.
3. **Contact Manager** – An app for managing contacts using **useReducer** and **context API**.
4. **Calculator** – A basic calculator performing arithmetic operations.
5. **Social Media App** *(In Progress)* – A project aimed at implementing user interactions, posts, and more.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React.js** – A JavaScript library for building interactive UIs.
- **React Icons** – Installed using `npm install react-icons --save`.
- **Bootstrap 5.3.3** – Installed using `npm i bootstrap@5.3.3` for styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Modern JavaScript features like arrow functions, spread/rest operators, etc.
- **CSS** – Custom styling for better UI/UX.
